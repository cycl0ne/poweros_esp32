//! The QPU back end: a SPIR-V fragment module turned into V3D 7.1
//! instructions.
//!
//! Three levels, so that everything checkable is checked on the host:
//!
//! 1. `Program` - what the words asked for, read through `sdk.facet.spirv`:
//!    the varyings, the one colour out, and the body as a list of steps
//!    with every id resolved to a place in that list.
//! 2. `Plan` - registers assigned and instructions chosen, nothing
//!    encoded. Every rule lives here and every test reads here.
//! 3. `qpu.zig`'s encoders, one call an instruction.
//!
//! **A wrong instruction hangs the renderer**, and a hang costs the
//! display and every other client of the V3D until the last one lets go.
//! So nothing here is invented: the only shapes emitted are the ones the
//! hand-written programs in `qpu.zig` already use on the board, and
//! anything else is refused. `qpu.last_section` and `qpu.end_of_program`
//! are spliced in as they are rather than built, because the scoreboard
//! wait is in the first of them.
//!
//! What it will not compile it refuses by name. A refusal is
//! `error_feature_not_present` at the pipeline, never a bad module: the
//! library has already turned down words that are not a module at all
//! (`CreateShaderModule`), so everything that reaches here is a module
//! this device cannot run rather than one that is wrong.
//!
//! **What is not settled, and is paid for rather than guessed.** Two
//! things the source does not state: how long an `ldunifrf` is before the
//! register it wrote may be read, and what the hardware makes of a
//! fragment program that reads fewer varyings than its record declares.
//! Neither is invented here. The first is waited out to the distance the
//! hand-written `flat_code` leaves (`uniform_latency`), padding with
//! `nop`s where the plan is tighter, because a longer wait cannot hurt;
//! the second never arises, because every varying the draw carries costs
//! its three instructions whether the body reads it or not. Both are
//! cheap, and both are the difference between a program like the ones
//! that were written by hand and a program like the ones that might be.
//!
//! **`Work` is one block, and `Code.words` points into it.** A driver
//! compiles every pipeline through the one `Work`, so the words have to
//! be copied into the block the V3D reads before anything else is
//! compiled. `Code.uniforms` is by value for that reason: a pipeline
//! keeps its floats for as long as it lives.
//!
//! **Where this will have to grow.** `settle` lays the program out as
//! straight-line phases - the varyings, the body, the splice, the colour
//! - which is the shape of a program that does not sample. A sampling
//! program interleaves: the coordinate writes, `wrtmuc`, the write to S
//! that starts the lookup, *then* the splice, and the arithmetic over the
//! texel after it (`qpu.texture_color_code`). So the splice is not a
//! boundary between the body and the colour; its rule is "after the last
//! varying read and the last TMU write, before the first tile-buffer
//! write". Samplers will rewrite that function rather than add to it.
//!
//! **The colour convention.** The graph's colours are 0 to 1, as Vulkan
//! has them, and the tile buffer takes half-floats of 0 to 1: a generated
//! program writes its colour out as it computed it, with no scaling. The
//! hand-written forms are the other way round - the program's vertex
//! function wrote `shader.channel`-scaled varyings for the cores, and
//! `_play.zig`'s `Carried.colors_from` divides them back out as the vertex
//! records are written. A pipeline whose fragment program is generated
//! carries its varyings `as_they_are`.
